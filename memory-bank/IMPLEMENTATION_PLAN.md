# AI-Menago Implementation Plan

üêπ This implementation plan focuses on remaining tasks for the AI-Menago project, excluding components already implemented in the existing codebase.

## Priority Levels and Timeline

Each task is assigned one of the following priority levels:
- **P1**: High priority - Must be completed in the first sprint (1-2 weeks)
- **P2**: Medium priority - Should be completed in the second sprint (3-4 weeks)
- **P3**: Low priority - Can be completed in the third sprint (5-6 weeks)

## Phase 1: Data Model Enhancements (P1)

### Step 1: Enhance User Profile Management
1. Examine current user profile handling
   - Review how user details are fetched from Supabase
   - Follow best practices for user profile management
   - **Validation**: Verify user data is correctly displayed based on the logged-in user
   - **MCP Note**: Use Supabase MCP for any database queries

2. Review user role detection 
   - Test how different UI elements appear based on user role
   - **Validation**: Log in with different roles to verify appropriate access control

### Step 2: Implement Recurring Tasks
1. Extend task data model to support recurring tasks
   - Add recurrence pattern fields (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Add recurrence end date or count fields
   - **Validation**: Admin can create tasks that repeat on schedule
   - **MCP Note**: Use Supabase MCP to update database schema

2. Create UI for recurring task management
   - Add recurrence options in task creation form
   - Create view to manage recurring task templates
   - **Validation**: Tasks automatically generate based on recurrence pattern

## Phase 2: Enhancements & Optimization (P1-P2)

### Step 1: Improve Error Handling (P1)
1. Implement more consistent error handling
   - Add user-friendly error messages where missing
   - Enhance console logging for debugging
   - **Validation**: Trigger various error conditions and verify handling

2. Add offline detection with proper UX/UI (P2)
   - Implement network status monitoring
   - Display notifications when offline (no data updates permitted)
   - Create clear visual indicators of offline status
   - **Validation**: Test app behavior in offline mode with appropriate messaging

### Step 2: Performance Optimization (P2)
1. Optimize list rendering
   - Review and improve FlatList configurations
   - Implement pagination for large data sets
   - **Validation**: Test scrolling performance with large datasets (1000+ items)

2. Enhance image handling
   - Review image compression before upload (target <500KB per image)
   - Implement better image caching
   - **Validation**: Compare image upload times and quality before/after

### Step 3: Enhanced Testing (P2)
1. Test on multiple platforms
   - Verify UI consistency across iOS, Android, and Web
   - **Validation**: Document and address platform-specific issues

2. Address edge cases
   - Test with slow network connections
   - Test with large datasets
   - **Validation**: App performs reliably under various conditions

## Phase 3: Feature Extensions (P2-P3)

### Step 1: Add Enhanced Filtering (P2)
1. Implement advanced task filtering
   - Add date range filters
   - Add status-based filtering
   - Add priority-based filtering
   - **Validation**: Filters correctly narrow down task lists
   - **MCP Note**: Use Supabase MCP for complex queries

2. Add sorting options
   - Implement sorting by due date, creation date, priority, etc.
   - **Validation**: Tasks sort correctly according to selected criteria

### Step 2: Implement Task Groups (P2)
1. Design and implement dual task grouping system
   - Implement tag-based grouping (multiple tags per task)
   - Implement hierarchical grouping (parent-child relationships)
   - **Validation**: Tasks can be grouped and filtered by both systems
   - **MCP Note**: Use Supabase MCP to extend database schema

2. Add group management UI
   - Create UI for managing both tag and hierarchical groups
   - Implement drag-and-drop for hierarchical organization
   - Add tag creation/management interface
   - **Validation**: Groups can be created and tasks assigned to them

### Step 3: Add Task Comments (P3)
1. Design comment data model
   - Extend database schema for task comments
   - Include timestamp, user, and content fields
   - Follow best practices for comment systems
   - **Validation**: Comments are properly stored in database
   - **MCP Note**: Use Supabase MCP to create comment table

2. Implement comment UI
   - Add comment thread to task details
   - Create comment entry form with validation
   - **Validation**: Users can add and view comments on tasks

## Phase 4: Deployment & Documentation (P3)

### Step 1: Finalize Environment Configuration (P3)
1. Review environment variables setup
   - Check .env file configuration
   - **Validation**: App uses correct environment variables in different environments

2. Set up production environment
   - Configure production Supabase instance
   - Implement security best practices
   - **Validation**: App connects to correct environment based on build type
   - **MCP Note**: Use Supabase MCP for production database setup

### Step 2: Prepare for Production Release (P3)
1. Review app.json and app.config.js
   - Verify app identifiers and metadata
   - Configure splash screen and icons
   - **Validation**: App package builds with correct metadata

2. Set up deployment pipeline
   - Configure EAS Build profiles
   - **Validation**: Test builds deploy correctly to test devices

### Step 3: Complete Documentation (P3)
1. Finalize developer documentation
   - Document setup process
   - Add architecture overview
   - **Validation**: New developers can set up the project following documentation

2. Create end-user documentation
   - Add user guides for each role
   - **Validation**: Users understand how to use app features
